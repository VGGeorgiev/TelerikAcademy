The Internet protocol suite is the
set of communications protocols used
for the Internet and similar networks,
and generally the most popular
protocol stack for wide area networks. 
It is commonly known as TCP/IP,
because of its most important protocols:
Transmission Control Protocol 
(TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), which 
were the first networking 
protocols defined in this standard. 
It is occasionally known as the DoD 
model due to the foundational 
influence of the ARPANET in the 1970s 
(operated by DARPA, an agency of the 
United States Department of Defense).
